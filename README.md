# Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Churn means customers or users who left the services or migrates to the competitor in the industry. It is very important for any organization to keep its existing customer and attract new ones if one of them fails it is bad for business. The goal is to explore the possibility of machine learning for churn prediction to retain a competitive edge in the industry.

In this Project I'm using Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classiifier to predict the customer churn.
